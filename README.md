# SOUNDWALKER LANDING PAGE

I made this project to improve my CSS and Basic JavaScript skills.

It also helped me learn about image and speed optimization.

The music players in the project were coded by me. Music files are not downloaded until the play button is pressed.

I understand that things that have no semantic meaning and are used only for visual purposes should be created with CSS, but in this project I had to define some background images as img element on the HTML side for better appearance.
